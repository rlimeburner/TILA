      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>Our mission is to protect the island’s resources, celebrate its cultural history, support initiatives to enhance the quality of life on the island amongst all landowners to coexist with nature. Presently TILA's focus is more homeowner oriented, with an emphasis on Tuckernuckers’ safety and health, landowner communication, and preserving and enjoying the island. An annual meeting of the Tuckernuck Island Landowners Association is usually held at the Firehouse on the 1st Sunday in July in combination with the Tuckernuck Firefighter’s Association (TFA). An elected TILA Executive Committee meets annually in July to discuss such issues as boat access to limited docks, road repair, erosion, health issues due to ticks and mosquitoes, natural resources, etc.

	<p><b>Richard Limeburner</b> wrote in 2025 a multi-visual <b>History of the Tuckernuck Lagoon from 1661 to 2025</b> that shows mostly old charts of the Nantucket region drawn by historic European navigators, supplemented with more recent aerial, satellite, and personal photos and videos. The Lagoon has opened and closed a few times in the past to become South Pond (Tuckernuck, Ed Coffin, 1891 - 1929, pg 2 and 180) and recently closed again in March 2025. The Lagoon was the landowners primary protected mooring area from the 1960's until 2025 when it rapidly closed off due to migrating sand from the south. The Lagoon is now called South Pond as it was in the past. This collection of old charts and recent satellite images can be found at</p>

      <h2>News & Upcoming Meetings</h2>
      <p><b>ACCESS 2025</b> - Since the lagoon closed during March 2025 seasonal moorings have been moved to various locations along the north shore. A private dock was installed May 2025 just NW of Great Rock on land owned by the Hanson family.</p>

      </div>

      <p><b>ACCESS 2025</b> - TILA does not plan to deploy the TILA dock at Brooks Landing during summer 2025. Presently there are 16 moorings at Brooks Landing. The LaFarge family allows landowners walking access over their land to boat moorings, but no vehicle parking will be allowed. Dropping off and picking up gear by vehicle will be allowed on the existing road, but no driving vehicles past Bam's boathouse nor over the dunes to the beach is permitted.  Please be aware that during a Northeast Storm no boats should be moored at Brooks Landing.</p>

      <p><b>ATV Use during 2025</b> - Many landowners commented during July and August 2025 about the number of ATVs on Tuckernuck this summer, the noise associated with their use, and how many ATV'd were speeding. We suggest that driving any vehicle with excessive speed is dangerous, illegal and strongly discouraged on Tuckernuck. Note, there are reasonable state laws for youth under 18 to operate ATVs responsibly. The state of Massachusetts requires that ATV operators must be 18 years of age or older, unless they have completed one mandatory session of an approved recreation vehicle safety and responsibility course. They must do this in the company of a parent or guardian. Those completing this session may operate an ATV at 16 and 17 years of age. Fourteen through 16-year-olds may operate an ATV with an engine capacity of 90 cubic centimeters or less.

		     <p>Firehouse No. 5 was built by landowners and the firetrucks and equipment were generously supported by the Nantucket Fire Department (NFD) Fire Chief Michael Cranston. We plan to soon clearly describe here how to respond to any emergency (first call 911) for a fire, a medical condition, and an accident or environmental issue. If a fire happened on Tuk, it could be devastating, Surprisingly, TILA issued 1) stiff brooms and 2) Indian 5 Gallon Poly Fire Pumps may be the best landowner first-defense for small fires. Getting Nantucket Fire Department professionals to Tuckernuck ASAP is of primary importance. A waterproof placemat-sized copy of the Tuckernuck Landowners 2025 Map above will soon be given to all landowners, and to the NFD and NPD to improve our emergency response preparations. For now you can right click the Landowner 2025 Map above to save a high resolution jpg image for your Tuckernuck home use. Please use this map to report any emergency location to 911.</p>

		<li> <b>Tuckernuck Tides </b>During 2013 R. Limeburner measured the sea surface variability with very precise pressure recorders, courtesy of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) at 8 locations around Tuckernuck. The semi-diurnal (12.4 hour) tide dominates the local movement of the sea surface around Tuckernuck. The wind speed and direction also have a strong influence on sea level, especially during storms with breaking waves when large amounts of sand are transported by strong currents. This results in extensive erosion and acretion of the shoreline in different areas. See <br>
